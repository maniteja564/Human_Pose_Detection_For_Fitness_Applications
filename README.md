This code can make you fit even with your busy schedules of work using the H5 model called as PhysioNet which is able calculate the accuracy of the pose in real-time
## Description
A computer vision problem called "human pose estimation" entails locating the locations of important body joints or landmarks in an image or video. For many applications, such as action recognition, gesture analysis, and human-computer interface, this task is essential. Using deep learning models, particularly those that make use of transfer learning with H5 models, is one efficient method for performing human posture estimation.

##Advantage of using H5 Model
As a result of their capacity to extract hierarchical features from huge datasets, H5 models—often linked to the Hierarchical Hybrid Deep Learning framework—offer a solid foundation for a variety of computer vision applications. On the other hand, transfer learning involves using pre-trained models on a related task to expedite training and enhance performance on a particular target task.
